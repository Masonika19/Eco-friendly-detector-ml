# Eco-Friendly Detector (Group Project)

This project was developed as a group academic project to classify eco-friendly
products based on environmental parameters. My contribution focused on data
understanding, feature selection, and explaining the machine learning workflow
used for classification.

The project covers problem formulation, preprocessing steps, model selection,
and performance evaluation at a conceptual level.

**Project Type:** Group academic project  
**Artifacts available:** Presentation (PPT)  
**Technologies discussed:** Python, Scikit-learn
